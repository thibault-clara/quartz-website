[In Development]

By studying at ISAE-SUPAERO, I am immersing myself into the wide range of conferences that enable us, students, to approach entrepreneurs, researchers, and industry leaders in the Sustainable Aviation space. 

I am aiming to condense all of these findings into a comprehensive overview of the growing European sector and beyond before releasing it to the public.
