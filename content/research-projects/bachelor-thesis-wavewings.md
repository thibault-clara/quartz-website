# About
Supervised by <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.schmehl/">Dr.-Ing Roland Schmehl</a>, a design synthesis exercise requiring the collaboration of 10 students for 10 weeks to conceptually develop a deep offshore floating platform harnessing wave energy from a point absorber whilst coupled to a leading-edge inflatable kite that unspools a drum-generator unit as it gains altitude. In doing so, we demonstrated the feasibility of designing a 2.45 MW unit implemented in a 1 GW farm that could rival the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and Global Warming Potential (GWP) of existing offshore renewables, namely off the west coast of Ireland.
