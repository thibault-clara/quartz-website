Use of <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/lr/organisatie/afdelingen/flow-physics-and-technology/facilities/low-speed-wind-tunnels/low-turbulence-tunnel">TU Delft's Low Speed Low Turbulence Wind Tunnel</a> to carry out study on NACA642A-015 wing model attached to six-degree balance. Wake rake used for pressure distribution reconstruction for -2° < AoA < 17° in ascending and descending order to observe hysteresis and flow reattachment behaviour. Additionally, the surface of the wing is heated to observe heat dissipation rates along the length of the boundary layer with the use of an IR camera — transition points from laminar to turbulent flow can be calculated accordingly. Numerical results are generated using XFOIL for 2D airfoil analyses and XFLR for 3D wing analyses and compared against experimental results.
