# About
Supervised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ferda-cansu-g%C3%BCl-280b88177/?originalSubdomain=fr" target="_blank">Ferda Cansu GÃ¼l</a> at Safran France, we developed statistical and clustering methods to filter signals gathered from ultrasonic guided waves propagating through cross-ply carbon panels. By doing so, we built a non-destructive testing model essential in beginning to understand cycle-to-failure of anisotropic materials, namely under delamination failure modes.

Specifically: Exploration of signal processing techniques (continuous wavelet transform, fast Fourier transform, various smoothing protocols) applied to ultrasonic guided waves data. Damage indices produced for damage detection in carbon-fiber reinforced polymer plates experiencing fatigue-induced delamination.
